GitHub Actions (YAML), GitLab Pipelines (YAML), and Jenkins (Groovy) share many similarities because they all serve the same purpose: defining CI/CD pipelines. However, they differ in syntax, flexibility, and execution style. Here’s a breakdown of the common elements:

---

### **Common Elements Across GitHub Actions, GitLab Pipelines, and Jenkins**

#### 1. **Declarative Pipeline Design**

All three platforms allow declarative pipeline design, where the steps for building, testing, and deploying are defined in a structured format.

* **GitHub Actions**: YAML
* **GitLab Pipelines**: YAML
* **Jenkins**: Groovy-based **Jenkinsfile**

---

#### 2. **Jobs**

All three support **jobs** as individual units of work. Jobs can:

* Run independently or sequentially.
* Be grouped into stages or steps.

**Examples:**

* **GitHub Actions**:
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - run: echo "Building..."
  ```
* **GitLab Pipelines**:
  ```yaml
  build:
    script:
      - echo "Building..."
  ```
* **Jenkins**:
  ```groovy
  pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
      stage('Build') {
        steps {
          echo "Building..."
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

---

#### 3. **Stages**

All three systems allow defining **stages** to organize pipelines into logical sections, such as `Build`, `Test`, and `Deploy`.

**Examples:**

* **GitHub Actions**: Implicitly uses job dependencies to define stages.
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    test:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      needs: build
  ```
* **GitLab Pipelines**: Explicitly defines stages.
  ```yaml
  stages:
    - build
    - test
  build:
    stage: build
    script:
      - echo "Building..."
  ```
* **Jenkins**: Stages are explicitly defined in the pipeline.
  ```groovy
  pipeline {
    stages {
      stage('Build') {
        steps {
          echo "Building..."
        }
      }
      stage('Test') {
        steps {
          echo "Testing..."
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

---

#### 4. **Environment Variables**

All three platforms allow defining and using environment variables globally or at the job/stage level.

**Examples:**

* **GitHub Actions**:
  ```yaml
  env:
    MY_VARIABLE: "value"
  jobs:
    build:
      steps:
        - run: echo $MY_VARIABLE
  ```
* **GitLab Pipelines**:
  ```yaml
  variables:
    MY_VARIABLE: "value"
  build:
    script:
      - echo $MY_VARIABLE
  ```
* **Jenkins**:
  ```groovy
  environment {
    MY_VARIABLE = "value"
  }
  stages {
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        echo "${env.MY_VARIABLE}"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

---

#### 5. **Triggers**

All three systems allow triggering pipelines based on specific events, such as pushes to a repository, pull requests, or scheduled jobs.

**Examples:**

* **GitHub Actions**:
  ```yaml
  on:
    push:
      branches:
        - main
  ```
* **GitLab Pipelines**:
  ```yaml
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main"'
  ```
* **Jenkins**:
  ```groovy
  triggers {
    pollSCM('* * * * *') // Polls the source code every minute
  }
  ```

---

#### 6. **Caching**

All three systems support caching dependencies to optimize pipeline execution.

**Examples:**

* **GitHub Actions**:
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    build:
      steps:
        - uses: actions/cache@v3
          with:
            path: ~/.npm
            key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
  ```
* **GitLab Pipelines**:
  ```yaml
  build:
    cache:
      paths:
        - .npm/
  ```
* **Jenkins**: Jenkins does not have a native caching feature but can use third-party plugins or scripts.
  ```groovy
  steps {
    sh 'npm install --cache .npm'
  }
  ```

---

#### 7. **Artifacts**

All three platforms allow storing artifacts (e.g., build files, test reports) for later use in the pipeline.

**Examples:**

* **GitHub Actions**:
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    build:
      steps:
        - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
          with:
            name: build
            path: build/
  ```
* **GitLab Pipelines**:
  ```yaml
  build:
    artifacts:
      paths:
        - build/
  ```
* **Jenkins**:
  ```groovy
  steps {
    archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'build/**'
  }
  ```

---

#### 8. **Parallel Jobs**

All three systems allow running jobs in parallel to speed up pipelines.

**Examples:**

* **GitHub Actions**: Jobs run in parallel by default unless dependencies are specified.
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    test:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  ```
* **GitLab Pipelines**: Jobs in the same stage run in parallel.
  ```yaml
  stages:
    - build
  build-job1:
    stage: build
    script:
      - echo "Building 1..."
  build-job2:
    stage: build
    script:
      - echo "Building 2..."
  ```
* **Jenkins**: Use `parallel` to run multiple stages simultaneously.
  ```groovy
  stages {
    stage('Parallel Builds') {
      parallel {
        stage('Build 1') {
          steps {
            echo "Building 1..."
          }
        }
        stage('Build 2') {
          steps {
            echo "Building 2..."
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

---

#### 9. **Reusable Configurations**

All three platforms support reusing configurations:

* **GitHub Actions**: Reusable workflows or composite actions.
* **GitLab Pipelines**: Includes and templates.
* **Jenkins**: Shared libraries.
